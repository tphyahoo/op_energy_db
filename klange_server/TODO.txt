-- in readme, have something like name_of_csv_files_dir_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz and the hash of this large tar file.
-- have build that creates data_chain.sql

add to README at 

http://dev.bergain.biz:3001/opdev/op_klange_server

web api.
url schema for direct getting csvs.
url schema for getting charts.

(we had this before, might need backporting)

log and linear modes

linear mode, y axis says hashes per satoshi
log mode, y axis says log(hashes per satoshi)

I'm thinking you could display both charts on the charting link.

implement this by adding a log(price) field in the csv. then should be easy.

***********

done by adding an input to the form -- this json

{'idBeg': '1', 'idEnd': '700000', 'makeChartname': 'Chart', 'inc': '1000'}

should include all parameters that are handled by code. currently it's missing span, which defaults to 2016

**********

bug in chart that includes a bunch of vertical and diagonal lines, strange artifacts.
to reproduce:
  block 1 to 700,000 (all time)
  inc: 10000

maybe this is because of matplotlib log chart, and it will go away after doing the log and linear modes task
